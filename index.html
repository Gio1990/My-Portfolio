        <h3>Sales, Recruiting, & Coaching</h3>
        <p>After professional basketball overseas, I shifted into coaching and spent 6+ years buildng a youth basketball program, which has become one of the largest youth sports organizations California. I've
          also spent 5+ years selling and recruiting for enterprise companies in Lending, Financial Services, and Security industries.</p>

        <h3>Development & Engineering</h3>
        <p>I've been officially doing Web Development for the last year. Like most, I began with learned HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Since then, I've gained more knowledge than I thought was possible from being self taught. My primary focus is now around
          Backend & Security Engineering. </p>

        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>From childhood, all the way to my mid 20's, I didn't miss a day of playing or watching sports. Nowdays you'll either see me on the golf course throwing my putter in frustration, or hanging with my friends watching some game that's on TV.

        <h3>Entertainment</h3>
        <p>Movies, shows, video games, you name it. I'm just as content playing games like Apex Legends or binge watching Game of Thrones as much as I am running up and down the basketball court.
